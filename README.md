# Four DC Motor Control Project Using L293D

This project involves controlling a system consisting of four DC motors using the L293D motor driver. The motors will perform the following actions:

1. Forward Movement: The motors will move forward for 30 seconds.
2. Backward Movement: The motors will move backward for 1 minute.
3. Shifting Left and Right: The motors will alternate between left and right for 1 minute.

## Required Components

- 4 DC Motors
- L293D Motor Driver
- Microcontroller (such as Arduino)
- Power Supply
- Connecting Wires

## Setup Instructions

1. Hardware Connections:
   - Connect the motors to the L293D motor driver according to the instructions.
   - Connect the motor driver to the microcontroller.
   - Ensure the power supply is correctly connected to the driver.

2. Software Setup:
   - Install the necessary libraries for motor control on the microcontroller.
   - Upload the provided code to the microcontroller.
